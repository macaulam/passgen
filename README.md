# Password Generator

A password generator that allows you to choose the length of the password and the characters that you would like to use would involve the following steps:

Prompt the user to input the desired length of the password.
Allow the user to select the characters they would like to use in the password, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Using the user's input, generate a random password of the specified length using the selected characters.
Display the generated password to the user.
The user can then use the generated password for their desired purpose.
